# Twitter-Sentiment-data-analysis-
The relationship between social network and climate change project using Deep Learning algorithms
The CSV file is the dataset of the tweets, id  of tweet and sentiments.This dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43943 tweets were annotated.

There is a file :Twitter Climate Change Sentiment Analysis models :is an analysis that we used to distinguish teets about climate change into one of the labels:
2: news - factual news about the climate change
1: pro - support the belief that climate change is caused by the man-kinds.
0: neutral
-1: anti - refuse the belief that climate change is caused by the man-kinds

This file contains also EDA, Data preparation, modele development and a commparaison between them(Logistic regression,decision tree,K neighbors,random forest,Linear support vector classifier, and ridge classifier), and a binary File Report. 

There is also a file analysis about builidng testing training and validating our model.

There is a file for ech of the tree deep learning algorithms (Word2vec , LSTM, and BERT).
